							<h2>About me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My fascination with technology started when I was seven, when my dad brought home our family's first desktop computer. As I explored the digital world, I was captivated by the endless possibilities it offered - from discovering new games and educational tools to staying connected with family and friends who lived far away. This early exposure ignited a curiosity that would eventually lead me to pursue a career in tech.</p>
						<p>Initially, I explored hardware and networking, but after a detour through the service industry, I realized building software is something that truly excites me. With an insatiable curiosity, commitment to learning, and drive to succeed, I'm excited to continue building new apps and tools for people to enjoy.</p>

						<h3>Technical skills</h3>
						<p>With a passion for tackling complex challenges, I've dedicated myself to mastering a range of programming technologies. My skillset includes:</p>
						<ul>
						<li><strong>Programming languages:</strong> Python, JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
						<li><strong>Front-end frameworks:</strong> React, Redux, Svelte/SvelteKit</li>
						<li><strong>Web development:</strong> HTML, CSS</li>
						<li><strong>Database management:</strong> PostgreSQL</li>
						<li><strong>Version control:</strong> Git</li>
						<li><strong>Agile methodologies:</strong> SCRUM, Kanban</li>
						</ul>
						<p>To further deve-lop my skills, I immersed myself in a year of intense self-study and bootcamp training with App Academy in 2022. This immersive experience culminated in the successful design, development, and deployment of four full-stack applications - two solo projects and two collaborative team efforts. Although the applications are no longer live, the experience and knowledge gained from building them remain invaluable.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Transferable Skills</h3>
						<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I bring valuable experience from my time in the restaurant industry. Working in management, I developed strong skills in:</p>
						<ul>
						<li><strong>Multitasking and prioritization</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Team management and support</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Effective communication</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Leadership and morale-boosting</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<p>I excel at identifying areas for improvement, bridging gaps, and streamlining workflows to drive productivity. My diligent work ethic, passion for learning, and effective communication skills have been key to my success in my career to date.</p>
